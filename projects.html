    <h3> 1.Eco Cycle Waste Management and Recycling Mobile App</h3>
        <div>
            <span class="bar">React Native</span>
            <span class="bar">Node.js</span>
            <span class="bar">Express.js</span>

        <p>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Developed a comprehensive mobile application that connects waste sellers and vendors for direct interaction. 
            The app bridges waste generators with recycling industries to promote the reuse and recycling of e-waste, 
            plastic waste, and iron waste. Features include real-time updates for users and recyclers, creating a 
            sustainable ecosystem for waste management.

        </div><br>
        <p>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Developed a Profile project. A portfolio serves as a powerful tool to showcase your talents, skills, experiences, and unique vision to potential clients, employers, or collaborators.
            It’s not just about displaying your best work; it’s about telling your story, conveying your value, and making a lasting impact.

        </div><br>
        <p>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Developed a GUI-based project, a Library Management System Project in Java and MySQL, or in other words book library management system code in java . 
           The users should be able to perform the operations such as Login, View Categories, Book details, Author details, Book issue, and Book return.
